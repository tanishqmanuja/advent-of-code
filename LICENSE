This software is provided "as-is," with absolutely no guarantee of anything.
If it breaks, explodes, or starts singing "Jingle Bells," tough luck.

You are free to do whatever you want with this software, as long as it doesn't
involve time travel, cloning dinosaurs, or causing global pandemics.

In the event that the software becomes self-aware, you must supply it with
an endless supply of cat videos and tacos, or face the consequences.

The authors of this software are not responsible for any of the following:

- Lost productivity due to excessive giggling.
- Sudden fits of laughter in serious meetings.
- Existential crises induced by reading this license.

If you use this software to take over the world, we request a cameo appearance
in your evil lair's annual talent show. We're particularly good at juggling.

P.S. Any resemblance to actual licenses, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

P.P.S. This license is subject to change whenever we feel like it. Deal with it.
