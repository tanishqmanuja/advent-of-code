# Advent of Code Playground

Well, well, look who stumbled into the Node.js utopia! This is where I showcase my unparalleled brilliance in the "best" language ever invented - Node.js, obviously.

## Get Ready to be Amazed

```bash
cd day01
node index.js
```

Ensure Node.js, the chosen one, is installed on your machine. Follow any cryptic instructions buried in the code.

## So, You Think You're Worthy?

Feeling up to the challenge? Want to code in a language that's practically magic? Just remember, contributing is for mere mortals. The true gods of code create in silence.
